# Web Vault OIDC builds for Vaultwarden

**This project is not associated with the [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) project nor Bitwarden, Inc.**

---

<br>

This is a repository to store custom builds of the [Bitwarden web vault](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/tree/master/apps/web) patched to work with [vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) and patched again to obtain a cleaner flow when using an SSO.

This generate three different versions :

- `button` closest to what is expected to be merge into [bw_web_builds](https://github.com/dani-garcia/bw_web_builds))
  - restore the SSO login button ([patch](oidc_button.patch)) (
  - allow organization invitation to survive sso account creation ([patch](oidc_invite.patch))
- `override` add additionally :
  - set `#sso` as the default redirect url
  - remove some unnecessary logic ([patch](oidc_override.patch))
  - display SSO errors and redirect to start of the flow ([patch](oidc_sso_errors.patch))
- `experimental` which stop sending the Master password hash to the server ([patch](oidc_experimental.patch))
